# Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-NG-
This repository has a collection of week-wise homework assignment that I have done for completing Machine Learning course on  Coursera. I am very proud of myself to have completed the full homework by myself. I have learnt a lot through this. Please have a look. The coding starts from Week 2. Hence there will be no Week 1. 
#Week2
This was my first homework of the infamous Machine Learning course by legend Andrew NG. The course is of Stanford University offered by Coursera.

In this project, I implemented the cost function for a Linear Regression model and also implemented gradient Descent algorithm on my own.
Feel free to have a look at my code.
I have written the codes in Octave.

Thanks
